# Delete Chrome Search URLs Autommagically (Unpacked Extension)
## What?
When a new tab is opened, delete all history URLs that match 'google.com/search' and 'duckduckgo.com'. 

This defaults to 24 hours. If you'd like a longer time frame, uncomment startTime and add an epoch value. 

## Why?
I *hate* that Chrome auto fills history results and that this "feature" cannot be disabled. There are plenty of forum posts by people asking for an option to disable this. 

(I'm forced to use Chrome in a certain environment. It is not my choice of browser personally.)

## How?
Load an unpacked extension in Chrome. Or repackage as an extension.
